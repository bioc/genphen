Description: Genetic association studies help us discover relationships between
    genotypes and phenotype. genphen is a computational tool for quantification
    of genotype-phenotype associations using a hybrid approach based on 
    statistical learning techniques and probabilistic models that are analyzed 
    computationally by Bayes inference.
