Description: Genetic association studies are an essential tool for studying the 
    relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. With genphen we can jointly
    study multiple phenotypes of different types, by quantifying the association 
    between different genotypes and each phenotype using a hybrid method which 
    uses statistical learning techniques such as random forest and support 
    vector machines, and Bayesian inference using hierarchical models.
