  \subsection{Changes:}{
    \itemize{
      \item Multiple traits (quantitative and dichotomous) handled
      \item Speed-up
      \item Bayesian hierarchical model implemented => multiple comparison solved
      \item Transition from effect size metrics to GLMs
      \item Posterior predictive checks automatic
      \item Retrospective power analysis available
      \item Stan model debugging possible
      \item Multicore speedup
      \item Phylogenetic bias quantification
      \item Data reduction with diagnostics procedure based on random forest
    }
  }

  \subsection{To do:}{
    \itemize{
      \item Include a CONFIG file to change internal parameters
      \item Add practical examples where genphen has been used.
      \item Implement modules for data augmentation
      \item Update todo after data augmentation
    }
  }
